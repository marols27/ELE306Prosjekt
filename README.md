# Welcome to the AMFY project
By Abdalaziz Sabon, Martin Repvik Olsb√∏, Yassin Karimi, and Fredrik Falk.

This is just a simple repository that me and some friends created and used during a scool project.
The project was about designing, calculating, and simulating som kind of autonomus base with a robot arm to perform some sort of task.
We chose to design a boat to pick plastic with, and the repository contains the package we created and used to simulate the robot we created.

If you wish to use this in your own project you will have to learn how to create and use a package, 
as we did during scool using their [web page](https://frdedynamics.github.io/hvl_robotics_website/courses/ele306/create-a-package) for this kind of teaching.
Here you can also look at the different steps to create your own complete robot simulation from creating a package to driving it arround 
using ros2, ubuntu foxy, gazebo, and manny other tools.

Hope you found it helpfull and joyfull.
